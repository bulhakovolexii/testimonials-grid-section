## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

While working on this project, I managed to refresh my knowledge of CSS Grid. I even tried to avoid using Flex layout, although in this case, I think Flex might have been more appropriate.

I had issues with some cards being overlapped by the shadows of cards that are higher in the document flow. I was able to resolve this by manipulating the order property.

I worked without a Figma layout, and the biggest challenge for me was tuning the box shadows to match the design as closely as possible.

### Continued development

I underestimated how difficult it is to maintain pixel-perfect design alignment without a Figma mockup — by the end, I honestly felt a bit burnt out, and it’s clear that fatigue affected my code quality. I’ll definitely need to revisit and refactor this project later

### Useful resources
